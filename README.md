## Help wanted
As you can see I did not spend a lot of time trying to make the page too attractive *I was to busy exploring*.
If, for some reason, you feel like making it a bit more attractive, *or a lot*, help yourself and submit a pull request!
I only ask that you stick with basic html, js, css and no packages. No particular reason, I just feel like keeping it simple and making it unnecessarily complicated.
